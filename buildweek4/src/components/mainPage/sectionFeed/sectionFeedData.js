    Our latest study shows that AI has become the new consumer companion. 
    AI tools now rank third in the top consumer subscription categories, behind movie and music subscriptions. Interactions with AI tools (multiple times a day) have nearly doubled since 2023.

    Certain trends in age demographics and use cases have been observed in the usage of AI tools as well: 
    ➡️ Over 50% of consumers view AI as a source of information and a collaborator. 
    ➡️ Older generations, especially boomers, are seeking emotional support via AI platforms. 
    ➡️ 7 in 10 Gen Z consumers are actively exploring AI tools. 
    ➡️ 50% of consumers are comfortable using an AI shopping assistant across platforms.
